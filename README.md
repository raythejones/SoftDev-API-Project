## Presenting the Presence of Presents in the Present

Created by: PPAPi
Group Members: Ray Jones, Jackie Xu, Philip Park, and Max Korsun

Overview:
This is a social website site used for people who want to connect with others, post their Christmas wishlists (of products from Walmart), and buy items for friends. Users are able to create and log in to personal accounts and send friend requests to other users. From there, they are able to view their friends' wishlists, watch Youtube videos about these products, and travel to the Walmart webpages dedicated to these items.
